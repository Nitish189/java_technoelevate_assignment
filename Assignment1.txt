Q1.Difference between length and length()?
Ans) length:-
     - length is a final variable applicable for arrays. With the help of the length variable, we can obtain the size of the array. 
     -The length variable is applicable to an array but not for string objects .
   

      length():
   - length() method is a final variable which is applicable for string objects. 
     -The length() method returns the number of characters present in the string. 
   - length() method is applicable for a string objects.
   - We can access the length of string element present at the particular index with the help of index value.

Q2. Explore for each loop?

   -->It starts with the keyword for like a normal for-loop.
   --> Instead of declaring and initializing a loop counter variable, you declare a variable that is the same type of the array, followed by a colon, which is then followed by the array name.
    -->Itâ€™s commonly used to iterate over an array or a Collections class.

   Syntax:-
      for(type var:array)
      {
       statements;
       }

Q3 Hybrid & Multiple inheritance?
Ans) A hybrid inheritance is a combination of more than one types of inheritance.
 For example when class A and B extends class C & another class D extends class A then this is a hybrid inheritance, because it is a combination of single and hierarchical inheritance

Multiple Inheritance:-  When one class extends more than one classes then this is called multiple inheritance. 
                        For example: Class C extends class A and B then this type of inheritance is known as multiple inheritance.
                         Java doesn't allow multiple inheritance.
